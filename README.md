You know when you want to watch a random episode from Netflix, but can't figure out which one? No, it's just me? Anyway, here's a thing that does that.

The deets
-----
This uses the Netflix [API](http://developer.netflix.com/), so if you want to clone and use this, you'll have to register for one.

The API key/secret go into the routes/config.js file. At the moment, it's set up to pull it from the heroku config variables, but you can change that.

Todos
-----
- add the episode description
- connect to the IMDB API and maybe suggest the "best" and "worst" episodes, rather than purely random
